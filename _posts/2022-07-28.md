## Biography
Señor Domiciano Carreño has been making drums for 40 years. He learned his craft in part by observing other drum-makers. Unlike some other drum-makers in the Dominican Republic, Domiciano Carreño does not play the drums; he crafts instruments for others to play. He works on his own, without assistance. At the time of our interview, Señor Carreño was 80 years old and had plans to stop making drums due to the physical demands such work requires.

> Yes, everything has a spirit. All things grow because they have a spirit. 
> Although it may not be the same spirit as people have, correct? The sun and the earth give to all things a power to grow and reproduce.”
